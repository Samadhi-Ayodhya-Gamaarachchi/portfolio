     <p>Hi there!</p>
      <p>ðŸ‘‹Iâ€™m Samadhi Ayodhya Gamaarachchi, a passionate BSc (Hons) IT student at the University of Moratuwa, specializing in Software Development and UI/UX Designing.
When Iâ€™m not coding or designing, you can find me dancing ðŸ’ƒ, participating in tech competitions, or brainstorming creative solutions for complex problems.
I believe in the power of technology to make life simpler, and I enjoy working on hardware and software projects. Some of my favorite tools include React, Arduino, and Git.
Feel free to explore my work and connect with me! ðŸš€</p>
